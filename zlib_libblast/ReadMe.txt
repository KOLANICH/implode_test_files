Well-known small compressed-decompressed pair [provided by Ben Rudiak-Gould](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.compression/c/M5P064or93o/m/W1ca1-ad6kgJ) and [used as a test in ZLib](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/cacf7f1d4e3d44d871b605da3b647f07d718623f/contrib/blast).

Ben Rudiak-Gould has provided a bit different pair with `C7` as the sixth byte of compressed stream, but it was incorrect and a fixed one is used.
