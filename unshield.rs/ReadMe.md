unshield (written in Rust)  test suite
======================================

[unshield](https://github.com/agrif/unshield) is an umpacker for InstallShield archives written in Rust.

It contains [some tests in a form of InstallShield archives](https://github.com/agrif/unshield/tree/master/src/examples).

We have extracted the raw implode streams from them, as long as the decompressed etalon contents from the repo.

Commits metadata is preserved, but the contents is the contents of the files.
